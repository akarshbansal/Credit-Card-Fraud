# Credit-Card-Fault-Analysis
Statistical Analysis and Prediction for Credit Card defaulters based on Taiwan's Credit banking data

Introduction
In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis. 
To increase the market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. 
At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and 
accumulated heavy credit and cash– card debts. The crisis caused a major blow to consumer finance confidence and 
it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders. In a well-developed financial system, crisis management is on 
the downstream and risk prediction is on the upstream. The major purpose of risk prediction is to use financial information, 
such as business financial statement, customer transaction and repayment records, etc., to predict business performance or individual 
customers’ credit risk and to reduce the damage and uncertainty.
